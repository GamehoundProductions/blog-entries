            <p>Hello World and welcome to my &ldquo;blog&rdquo;, which is not really a blog, but rather a series of notes on video games, movies, books, development and who-knows-what-else. I am a software engineer, not a writer and am not pretending to
                be one. For that, there is no intention of scribbling a typical English 101 essay with a bunch of words, introductions, conclusions and etc.</p>

        <div class="column is-12">
            <p>My goal here is to pinpoint things in the Entertainment medium that I take interest in. I want to believe this process will help improve creativity as well as get better understand what makes something &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. Maybe will throw in
                some development notes as well. If someone will find this rambling useful or entertaining - that would be great too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column is-12">
            <p>The other hope is to try find like-minded people or those who are passionate about video games to share and express their love for this amazing medium without that pile of anger and hate that you might have seen here and there in comment sections,
                forums, reviews and etc all over the internet. Disliking or hating something is natural, but understanding why those emotions are triggered and respecting the opposite opinion on the matter is the key to a good discussion and sharing of
                personal experiences. This is something that I'm learning myself all the time and am planing to share it somewhere around here.</p>

            <p>I've wanted to try something like that for a while now, but would find million reasons not to (fear is one of them). But had to try this eventually to let it go, and better sooner than later. So, whatever happens - happens.<br/>Thanks for
                reading and hope to "see" you around!</p>
