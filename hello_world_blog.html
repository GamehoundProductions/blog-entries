  <p>Introduction slash Disclaimer</p>
  <p>Hello World and welcome to my “blog”, which is not really a blog, but rather a series of notes for myself on video games, movies, books, development and who-knows-what-else. I am a software engineer, not a writer and am not pretending to be one. For that, there is no intention of writting a typical English 101 essay with a bunch of filler words, introductions and conclusions.</p>
  <p>My goal here is to pindown things that I like and don’t like in the Enterntainment medium. I want to believe this process will help improve creativety as well as get better understand what makes something “fun”. Besides that, will try writing down some notes on development processess. Maybe at some point it will be of use to looking back through this pile of words in a asearch for who-knows-what. And if someone will find this useful or entertneining - that would be great too.</p>
  <p>Here goes nothing…</p>
