            <p>Hello World and welcome to my &ldquo;blog&rdquo;, which is not really a blog,but rather a series of notes for myself on video games, movies, books, development and who-knows-what-else. I am a software engineer, not a writer and am not pretending
                to be one. For that, there is no intention of writting a typical English 101 essay with a bunch of words, introductions, conclusions and etc.</p>

            <p>My goal here is to pinpoint things in the Enterntainment medium that Itake interest in. I want to believe this process will help improve creativety as well as get better understand what makes something &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. Besides that, will
                try writing down some notes on development processess. Maybe at some point it will be of use to looking back through this pile of words in a asearch for who-knows-what. And if someone will find this useful or entertneining - that would
                be great too.</p><br/>
