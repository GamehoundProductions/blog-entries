            <p>&nbsp;The book has an interesting take on the concept of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo;and human existence in the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; world. Back in the days, when I had a wildly growing mustache that I neglected to shave of, we didn't have that
                kind of books included in a Belorussian high school curriculum. Or maybe I wasn't paying attention. The thing is, even if I would read it at that age, I would probably not "get it".</p>

            <p>&nbsp;There exist a world of advanced technology. A world where there are no concept of Family; no mothers or father; where humans are genetically bred, raised and &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; for different social groups to perform their specific
                tasks (jobs) in the civilized world.&nbsp;
                <em> &ldquo;Everyone belongs to everyone else&rdquo;</em> - the concept of &rdquo;freedom&rdquo; expressed throughout the book.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Then there is also&nbsp; <em>soma</em> - a drug everyone takes to keep them happy. No anger; no hate; no jealousy and such. Here goes <em>Utopia</em></p>
            <p>And then there is a less civilized world - savages, who breed, get married, hunt, perform religious rituals and such - all the things that are familiar to us readers. Both cultures sees each other as something unnatural, inappropriate or even
                alien. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me if the were any conflicts present at the time of the told story (but wars were ). One thing, though, is that modern world had no interest in the land owned by savages, so maybe for that - there were no
                open conflicts between them.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;This is a simple concept to comprehend, but difficult to execute. <em>&rdquo;Easy to learn - hard to master&rdquo;.</em> - as one might say. I think the Creator must truly believe and visualize the world him/herself to design it properly.
                Oh maybe there are workarounds... I don't really know.</p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;For the first couple chapters, Aldous goes deep into the detail in how factory operates. How fast the conveyor belt moves; for how many days; how many inches per unit and so on and so forth. Then, there is enough description of the world
                around the characters and just enough outside to convey whatever thought is appropriate at the moment.</p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;Going deep into details can be a good and a bad thing. And there is always truth somewhere in the middle. Russian classical writers Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are one of those authors who can take two pages easily describing a single small
                room. Casual reading allows you to read it through fast enough to get the idea (if you choose to do so), but if there is a test in tomorrow's class... yeah, its gonna suck.</p><br/>

            <p> &nbsp;The book got me thinking about the differences in human perceptions and how lack of understanding one's views create a communication gap. People put "labels" on each other for one reason or another.</p>
            <p>Author never seem to imply which side is better or worse; who is good or bad. He just describes how things are from the minds of characters in particular scenes. I like that approach. That makes readers decide for themselves which part of
                that world they think they would &ldquo;fit in&ldquo;. As always, it is a mixed blessing. And as always, one must choose for which audience of that mix one wants to appeal to.</p>
            <p class="panel bg-yellow-less padding-1 comic-font" style="margin-left: 0rem; margin-right: 0rem;"><strong>Not choosing a side as a story teller can be a great thing if you want to persuade some sort of controversy either in behavior,
 characters' personalities, the situation or which color is better.
 Lay out &rdquo;facts&rdquo; on the subject as-is an let users
 decide for themselves.</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;There has been many stories since the book was written in 1931 about Utopia. And a great deal of the involves artificially created &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; in humans by the use of some sort of drugs. In Brave New World, though, I wonder
                if <em>soma</em> is even as critical part of the narrative as it tries(?) to be. I found <em>human conditioning</em> far more believable aspect of the story that resonates better with our world. A Utopia story without a magic drug, but
                rather based on &ldquo;brainwashing&rdquo; would sound a bit more appealing to me.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The writing style in which Aldous H. describes certain actions in the book that help reader to "feel" the scene. Short sentences or describe fast, abruptactions or mid-sentence &quot;in-bracket&quot; insertions to convey emotions and
                reactions:</p><br/>
