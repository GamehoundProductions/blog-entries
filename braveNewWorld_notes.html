<h3>Brave New World (by Aldous Huxley)</h3>
<p>The book has an interesting take on the concept of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; and human existence in the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; world.</p>
<p>Story/premise overview:<br />There exist a world of advanced technology. A world where there are no concept of Family; no mothers or father; where humans are genetically bred, raised and &ldquo;conditioned&rdquo; for different social groups to perform their specific tasks (jobs) in the civilized world.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Everyone belongs to everyone else&rdquo;</em>&hellip; Oh and there is also&nbsp;<em>soma</em>&nbsp;- a drug everyone takes to keep them happy. No anger; no hate; no jealousy and such. Here goes &lt;span style=&ldquo;text-decoration: underline;&rdquo;&gt;Utopia&lt;/span&gt;.</p>
<p>And then there is a less civilized world - saveges, who breed, get married, hunt, perform religios rhituals and such - all the things that are familiar to us readers. Both cultures sees each other as something un-natural, inappropriate or even alien. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me if the were any conflicts present at the time of the told story. One thing, though, is that modern world had no interest in the land posessed by savages, so maybe for that - there were no open conflicts between them.</p>
<p>- This book got me thinking about the differencies in human perceptions of the world. It almost as if conflicts based of angre and hate is the result of inability to accept or understand others&rsquo; perceptions.</p>
<p>- There has been many stories since the book was written in 1931 about Utopia. And a great deal of the involves artificially created &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; in humans by the use of some sort of drugs. In Brave New World, though, I wonder if <em>soma</em> is even as critical part of the narative as it tries to be. <em>Conditioning</em> of humans to believe or do whatever is needed of them is where the story resonates with our world. A Utopia story without a magic drug, but rather based on &ldquo;brainwashing&rdquo; would sound a bit more appealing to me.</p>
<p><br />- The other thinng is interesting is the style in which Aldous H. describe certain actions in the book. Short sentancies o describe fast, abrubt actions or mid-sentance "in-bracket" insertions to convey emotions and reactions:</p>
<p>&nbsp; "...<em>and not only abnormal, actually immoral <strong>(no!)</strong>: and had therefore been rigorously suppressed...</em>"</p>
<p><em>&nbsp; "Whisk, the cathedrals; whisk, whisk, King Lear and the Thoughts of Pascal. Whisk, Passion; whisk, Requiem; whisk, Symphony; whisk &hellip;"</em></p>
