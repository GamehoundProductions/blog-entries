            <p>- Exploring the world, searching for collectibles and hunting can be very meditative process.</p>
            <p>- On the contrary, action sequences (robberies, chases, etc) and missions does feel fast paced and dynamic.</p>
            <p>- Main quests and some portion of side quests adds to a pace and breaks the meditative loop.</p>
            <p>- This is also achieved through the character&apos;s interaction with the world: picking up each item one by one; animations for walk, pickup, mounting the horse, unholster weapons and etc are relatively &quot;slow&quot; when outside the combat.
                Or rather, it is &quot;fast enough&quot; to convey the appropriate mood and pace.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <div class="column is-12">
            <p>- Weirdly enough, shooting feels &quot;fun&quot; when in a &quot;dead eye&quot; mode getting headshots, but it felt dull when shooting in any other parts of the body but head. I think it because with headshots you get an instant feedback from
                minor ragdoll or animation. Body shoots feels weak, with minor feedback since enemies does not react as &quot;choreographically&quot;. I think this is to convey a more realistic feel for the game.</p>
            <p> This actually hit an interesting behavior, where I wasn&apos;t invested into shooting, I would avoid that type of gameplay if I&apos;m given a choice, since &quot;running and gunning&quot; is less satisfying for me here.</p>
            <p class="panel bg-yellow-less padding-1 comic-font"
                style="margin-left: 0rem; margin-right: 0rem;"><strong>Gamedesign Note:&nbsp;</strong>if I would want to direct a none-lethal or none-shooting gameplay, make shooting mechanics somewhere in the high-middle(~7 out of 10) range on the &quot;fun&quot; scale. &quot;Hitman: Absolution(2012)&quot;,
                for example, has a fun shooting mechanics which baits to go "loud" more than of stealth.</p>
            <p>- I like the variety of weapons and their usage for hunting sequences, where each weapon has its use on different animals. However, against human combat, I didn&apos;t find practical use for more than one or two guns. Maybe it depends on the
                individuals&apos; play style? Or maybe its purpose is to be another detail that adds to the scale of the world.</p>

            <p>- Characters has their own past, their own stories, pattern of behavior and such. They feel real and that what kept we hooked in to the story. What important here, I think, is that it is doesn&apos;t matter if we&apos;ve seen those characteristics
                before as long as the bubble head on the screen has a human behavior, good or bad, that we can recognize as &quot;human&quot; through their stories, behaviors, dialog and so on and blah-blah-blah.</p>

            <p>- Its been a while since I actually enjoyed collecting those, presumably, useless things. In RDR2, in a search for the cigarette cards or rock cravings and whatnot, you get to explore the world, stumble upon mini side quests or discover some
                interesting locations you might miss otherwise. Plus, you get a reward for getting it all, whether it is cash, crafting goodies or even a cutscene that adds up to your emotional feedback. It is a very simple concept, yet few games get
                it right.</p>
            <p class="panel bg-yellow-less padding-1 comic-font" style="margin-left: 0rem; margin-right: 0rem;"><strong>Gamedesign Note:&nbsp;</strong>Collectibles should reward players beyond the achievements popup. It Must has a value in the game world: cash, tools, weapons, whatever else.</p>

        <div class="column is-12">
            <p>- I absolutely hated it. Those type of challenges doesn&apos;t add to "enjoyable" replayabilaty. Most of them doesn&apos;t add a different or additional experience to the same mission (like using different path or playstyle), so it feels more
                like a "chore" and torture when going for 100%, which I usually like to go for in games these days.<br/>I think the reason why RDR2's challanages triggered negative response for me, is because they mostly felt out of place and unnatural
                and, maybe, felt as punishment by gamedesigners. Weird. I have the same feelings about Assassin's Creed challanges (before the Origins which I haven't played yet)</p>
            <p class="panel bg-yellow-less padding-1 comic-font" style="margin-left: 0rem; margin-right: 0rem;"><strong>Gamedesign Note:&nbsp;</strong>Per mission challenges should add to the experience (e.g. differrent route or gameplay style) in some "fun" way.</p>
