Hi! My name is Zach and I am a Software Engineer with a great love for Video Games. I've created GamehoundGames to share my passion for the Video Games and bring like minded people together.

Here, you can find my [Blog](https://gamehoundgames.com/blog), where I write about Video Games, Software Engineering and just some random stuff.

[Weekly News Digest](https://gamehoundgames.com/news) is where you can find [subjectively] most relevant and interesting Video Game stories of the week, that I cherry-pick myself. At some point, I just got tired of all that noise provoking click-bait headlines a lot of modern news website do. So I've decided it to clean it up for people similar to myself in that regard. Though, I still have to go through the noise, but at least You don't have to.

[Calendar](https://gamehoundgames.com/news) is a fun (from a tech standpoint) little project that helps you discover upcoming or past releases and the games that you could have not noticed otherwise.

### A bit about myself
I was born in Belarus and was fortunate to get my hands on a NES system known at a around 5 years old. Except it was popular pirated version of the console known as [Dendy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendy_(console)). At the time, of course, we believed it was a real deal. Long story short, the first few games I played with my brother and my dad was [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) and, of course, [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.). We had only one TV at our house, plus my parents where concerned for our health (since the industry was pretty new at the time, and those CRT TVs were probably harder on the eyes), so getting that 1 hour time of gaming was the most anticipated thing the kid could imagine. (In retrospect, I'm gratefully they did, cause, at the very least, that kept me exited about games for a long time).

I remember, one day we stayed at our grandparents for a week, taking our Dendy with us. They had that older 1987 TV Horizon C355, that we hooked the console to. And, as a cherry on a pie, it was in the room we were sleeping in, separate from our grandparents, being awesome outside of the whole gaming context, would let us have the time of our lives with the console in the after hours on the weekend. We played the newly discovered [Jackal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal_(video_game)) game in coop mode with my brother, which instantly triggers the nostalgic memories of those times every time I see the screenshots of the game or my brain just randomly decides to remember. I think we watched Maximum Overdrive one of those nights on that TV and got shitless scared. But that's a different story...

Then there was Sega Genesis; my brother's friend's Playstation 1; then console gaming fell of of my radar, replaced by PC; then back to PS3 and PS4. A lot of fond memories and great games discovered: [Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)), [Battle Toads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battletoads_(video_game)), [Streets Of Rage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_(video_game)), [True Lies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Lies_(video_game)), [Commandos 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos_2:_Men_of_Courage), [Hitman 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman:_Codename_47), [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil)... and the list goes on and the whole bunch of stories to tell about each of those gaming eras I went through, but, maybe, some other time.

Long story short, Video Games has been with me for the most part of my life and being a real passion till these days. Additionally, I've been a Software Engineer since about 2014 working with different technologies from Backend to Automation to FrontEnd while toying with Game Development on a side. 

Thanks for stopping by and hope to see You around!
