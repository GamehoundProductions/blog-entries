Hi! My name is Zach Volchak - Software Engineer engineer since 2014 with a big love for Video Games since yearly childhood. I've created GamehoundGames to share my passion for the Video Games with like minded people. You can find my [Weekly News](https://gamehoundgames.com/news) digest where I cherry pick [subjectively] the most interesting industry stories of the week, to remove all the unnecessary noise and click baiting from all that overwhelming pool of information. Also, check out the [Calendar](https://gamehoundgames.com/calendar) to discover current, upcoming or past game releases throughout the years.

And, of course, Subscribe to my Newsletter and get the newest [Blog](https://gamehoundgames.com/blog)  posts straight to Your virtual door!
