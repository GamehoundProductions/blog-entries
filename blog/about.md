I am a Software Engineer engineer since 2014 with a big love for Video Games since yearly childhood. Self-taught Unity3d and released my first game [Bunny Hop](https://gamehoundgames.com/projects) as a side project from my day job, just for fun and to learn the basics of game development.

Tune in for [Weekly News](https://gamehoundgames.com/news) digest, where I cherry pick [subjectively] the most interesting industry stories of the week, to remove all the unnecessary noise and click baiting articles from all that pool of information.

Also, check out the [Calendar](https://gamehoundgames.com/calendar) to discover current, upcoming or past game releases throughout the years. 

And, of course, Subscribe to my Newsletter and get the newest [Blog](https://gamehoundgames.com/blog) posts about Video Games, Software Engineering and who-knows-what-else straight to Your virtual door!
