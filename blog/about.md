Hi! My name is Zach and I am a Software Engineer with a great passion for Video Games. I've created GamehoundGames to share my interest and my views on the entertainment industry and bring like minded people together. 

I was born in Belarus and was fortunate to get my hands on a NES system known at a around 5 years old. Except it was popular pirated version of the console known as [Dendy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendy_(console)). At the time, of course, we believed it was a real deal. Long story short, the first few games I played with my brother and my dad was [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) and, of course, [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.). We had only one TV at our house, plus my parents where concerned for our health (since the industry was pretty new at the time, and those CRT TVs were probably harder on the eyes), so getting that 1 hour time of gaming was the most anticipated thing the kid could imagine. (In retrospect, I'm gratefully they did, cause, at the very least, that kept me exited about games for a long time).

I remember, one day we stayed at our grandparents for a week, taking our Dendy with us. They had that older (about 10 years old at the time) TV Horizon C355, that we hooked the console to. And, as a cherry on a pie, it was in the room we were sleeping in, separate from our grandparents, being awesome outside of the whole gaming context, would let us have the time of our lives with the console in the after hours on the weekend. We played the newly discovered [Jackal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal_(video_game)) game in coop mode with my brother, which instantly triggers the nostalgic memories of those times every time I see the screenshots of the game or my brain just randomly decides to remember. I think we watched Maximum Overdrive one of those nights on that TV and got shitless scared. But that's a different story...

Since then, video games have been a part of his life as much as a daily cup of coffee.
