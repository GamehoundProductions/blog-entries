<p>Introduction slash Disclaimer&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hello World and welcome to my "blog", which is not really a blog, but rather a series of notes for myself on video games, movies,&nbsp;books and who-knows-what-else. I am a software engineer, not a writer and am not pretending to be one. For that, there is no intention of writting a typical English 101 essay with a bunch of filler words, introductions and conclusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My goal here is to pindown things that I like and don't like in the Enterntainment medium. I want to believe this process will help improve creativety as well as help understand what makes something "fun". So that at some point, when I sit down to brainstorm some game ideas, I could look up this scribbles to draw inspiration from or who-knows-what-else.</p>
